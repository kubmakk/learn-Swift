# 🍎 Learning Swift: My Journey to Mastery

Welcome to my Swift learning repository! This project serves as a living document of my progress, code snippets, and the mental models I'm building while mastering the Swift programming language and the iOS ecosystem.

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

* **Foundation:** Master Swift syntax, optionals, and memory management (ARC).
* **Paradigm Shift:** Move from imperative coding to **Protocol-Oriented Programming**.
* **Frameworks:** Build fluency in **SwiftUI** and Combine/Swift Concurrency.
* **Architecture:** Understand MVVM and Clean Architecture.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

I’ve organized my learning into the following milestones:

| Level | Topic | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 | **Swift Basics** | Variables, Control Flow, and Optionals. | Completed |
| 🟡 | **Intermediate** | Enums, Structs vs Classes, and Closures. | In Progress |
| 🟠 | **Advanced** | Generics, Protocols, and Memory Safety. | Not Started |
| 🔴 | **Concurrency** | Async/Await, Tasks, and Actors. | Not Started |

## 📚 Key Concepts I've Mastered

### 1. The Power of Optionals

Swift’s safety comes from its handling of `nil`. I've focused on avoiding force-unwrapping (`!`) in favor of:

* `if let` for simple unwrapping.
* `guard let` for early exits in functions.
* `nil-coalescing` (??) for providing default values.

### 2. Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP)

Instead of deep class hierarchies, I am learning to use protocols to define behavior.

### 3. Swift Concurrency

Moving away from completion handlers to the modern `async/await` syntax to write more readable, thread-safe code.

## 🛠️ Resources I’m Using

* [Swift.org Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) - The "source of truth."
* **100 Days of SwiftUI** (Hacking with Swift) - For practical project building.
* **Swift Playgrounds** - For rapid prototyping and testing logic.
